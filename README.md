# Maximum-Occurring-Character

Given a string, return the character that appears the maximum number of times in the string.  The string contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and CASE MATTERS.
If there is a tie in the maximum number of characters, return the character that occurs first in the string.

Input
text = abbbaacc

Output
a

Since a and b both occur 3 times, a appears first in the string, and a is the answer.

maximumOccurringCharacters takes a string as a parameter and returns a char.
